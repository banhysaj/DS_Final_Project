# DS_Final_Project
The goal of this program is to manage an inventory for a simple game, where the user can have many items which may be used for Defense, Attack and Durability.
The inspiration for this program is a game called Survivor.io, where after each fight the player collects lots of items, seperated into the categories we mentioned above.

In this project we have implemented a few types of Data Structures such as: Queues, ArrayLists and Linked Lists. 

Another important thing used in this program is MergeSort algorithm, more of the algorithm is mentioned in the PowerPoint presentation. 

My key focus was the MergeSort algorithm and the Data Structure types, the algorithm is used to sort items based on their name, guns or armors and then on their stats, such as defense or attack. 

A more clear explanation is shown on the PowerPoint presentation and the program itself.

Thank you!
